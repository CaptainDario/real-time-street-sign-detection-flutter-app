## Disclaimer

This is a proof of concept implementation of a cross platform tensorflow lite based street sign detection app.
Its purpose is to check the viability of on-device machine learning on off-the-shelf mobile hardware for autonomous driving. This means that the app or parts of it are not meant to be used in production and are not tested with a wide range of devices. Therefore, expect bugs and crashes on untested devices.
